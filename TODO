end-to-end nym-based security
link-level security

try to get the root authorities to set up a secure, usable NS-list system
have dnscache-conf keep track of copies of dnsroots.global
incorporate automatic NS-list upgrades

consider dead-server table in dnscache or in kernel

IPv6 lookups
maybe reverse IPv6 lookups; what a mess
DNS over IPv6

Distributed cache:
have a background thread that will clear out expired entries in cacherequesthandler.c
have servers hashed to multiple virtual locations within the circular hash space
cache_delete from distributed cache server
